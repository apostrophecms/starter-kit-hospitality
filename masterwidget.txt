Master widget approach:

0. Follow the guidelines of apostrophecms v3 widget set up
  - Set up of widget through cli: apos add widget two-column
  - First create the module configuration file (/modules/my-component-widget/index.js), extend the core widget type module, and add a widget label for editors. Include the widget type's field schemas needed
  - Include a reference to the widget within the modules section of apostrophecms main app.js
  - The widget scss approach: The scss file should be located within the module folder /modules/my-model/ui/src/index.scss. This file can contain references to

  @import "../../../asset/ui/src/scss/variables";
  @import "../../../asset/ui/src/scss/functions";

  @import "../../../asset/ui/src/scss/mixins";

  if needed. These imports contain the variables, functions and mixins used for the theme.
  
  - Client-side JavaScript for widgets should be tied to the widget module and thus located within /modules/my-component-widget/ui/src/index.js
  - Naming for widget to match it's parent name, i.e. apos.util.widgetPlayers.my-component / selector: '[data-my-component]', no need to include -widget in these cases
  - lib/area.js - to include base apostrophecms widgets, being apostrophecms/rich-text, apostrophecms/video and apostrophecms/image, no html one as this is a security concern. Then extra objects for full widget list?, as well as custom widget lists. Rich text to have basic tools and full tools options
